## Django signals

````doctest
1.)signal dispatcher‚Äù which helps decoupled applications get 
notified when actions occur elsewhere in the not framework
2.)Only use signals to avoid introducing circular dependencies. 
PRE SAVE:
    Actions to take before the model's save is called.
    Emit a pre-save signal. Pre-process the data.

POST SAVE:
    Actions to take after the model's save is called.
    Emit a post-save signal. Post-process the data.
````
````python
@receiver(pre_save, sender=CreditAmount)
def credit_loan(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Pre save", instance.name, instance.amount)
    credit_data = {'loan user': instance.name, 'loan amount': instance.amount}
    LoanAmount.objects.create(loan_details=json.dumps(credit_data))

@receiver(post_save, sender=DebitAmount)
def debit_balance(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Post save", instance.name, instance.amount)
    BalanceAmount.objects.create(debit_person=instance, date=datetime.datetime.now())
